# .dotfiles
A repo for all my dotfiles!

I considered deleting configs for programs I no longer use for simplicity's sake but decided against it, since I might want to use them later.

_Below is my best attempt at listing all of the things I will have to install for the configured stuff to work, in no particular order. I very well might've missed something._
This attempt turned out to be a very unsuccessful one, so I'm deleting everything.

TODO: Add better configuration instructions next time I setup a machine
